# About Me

Here is **ZiAng Yang (杨子昂)**. I am an ungraduate student in the Department of Engineering at Peking University, advised by [Prof. Yue Yang](https://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/facultyaz/891197.htm) and [Prof. Jin-Han Xie](https://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/facultyaz/918395.htm).  I have worked on some simple work on computational fluid dynamics and environmental fluid dynamics.

I am looking for a PhD opportunity for Fall 2025 admission. If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me through e-mail.

## Research Interests

- Fluid Mechanics
- Applied Mathematics
- Applied Physics
- Computer Science

I am interested in applying mathematics and physics to the real world, and I am also interested in emerging computer technologies such as artificial intelligence. During the remaining period of my undergraduate studies, I hope to broaden my horizons and acquire a solid foundation of relevant knowledge. I wish to devote my talent to these meaningful causes and bring well-being to society.
