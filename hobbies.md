## Hobbies

Playing badminton, singing, drawing comics, and traveling, Solving Rubik’s cubes

I enjoy traveling around the world, as it not only relaxes my mind but also allows me to experience diverse cultures and traditions while savoring local delicacies and beautiful landscapes.

I’ve been playing with Rubik’s cubes since elementary school, and I currently own more than 10 different types! Solving cubes has expanded my thinking and helped me make many like-minded friends.
